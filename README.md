# MVault-PHP
This simple interface authenticates to the PBS Membership Vault (or QA) environment and can create, edit, retrieve and search membership records.

To get started, edit the config section of index.php with your station's callsign, API key, and API secret. It is highly recommended to play around with the QA environment first before changing records on your live MVault environment.
